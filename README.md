# BufferTest

This is an experiment on the Java TCP/IP communication(Socket). I was testing how fast is the communication using different buffer sizes.
During the experiment i was generating random byte data and measuring how long is the roundtrip between the server and the client.

All the experiments were done using 1Gbps connection. For the cloud test, one of the European Google VM-s were used.

The project is made in Netbeans 8.0.2, using JDK 1.8.
